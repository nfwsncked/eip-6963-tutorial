## üìñ Section 1: Requesting Available Providers

Simplicity is the key to adoption.

The [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) protocol works in a pretty straightforward way:

A DApp can fire the `requestProvider` event at any moment, and as a reaction,
every [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) compatible wallet extension in your browser instantly
fires `announceProvider` event in response.

To see this interaction in action, let's add an event listener for `announceProvider` and emit the `requestProvider`
event.

First let's define all the necessary classes and interfaces in one go:

**// üìÅ file:  [types.ts](src/injected-wallet-provider/types.ts)**

```typescript
// Declare a global interface to extend the WindowEventMap with a custom event "eip6963:announceProvider"
declare global {
    interface WindowEventMap {
        "eip6963:announceProvider": EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent;
    }
}

// Define a class for the "eip6963:requestProvider" event
export class EIP6963RequestProviderEvent extends Event {
    constructor() {
        super("eip6963:requestProvider");
    }
}

// Define an interface for the "eip6963:announceProvider" event
export interface EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent extends Event {
    type: "eip6963:announceProvider";
    detail: EIP6963ProviderDetail;
}

// Define an interface for the provider details
export interface EIP6963ProviderDetail {
    info: EIP6963ProviderInfo;
    provider: EIP1193Provider;
}

// Define an interface for the wallet extension metadata
export interface EIP6963ProviderInfo {
    uuid: string; // Unique identifier of the wallet extension announcement, keep in mind it changes on every request-announcement cycle
    name: string; // Name of the wallet extension
    icon: string; // Icon for the wallet extension
    rdns: string; // Reverse DNS name of the wallet extension
}

// Define an interface for the EIP1193 provider.
// It's the same interface we are used to access with 'window.ethereum'
export interface EIP1193Provider {
    request(request: {
        method: string;
        params?: Array<any> | Record<string, any>;
    }): Promise<any>;
}
```

---

The global interface **WindowEventMap** declaration above is used to extend the existing **WindowEventMap** interface
with a new event type, **'eip6963:announceProvider'**.

**EIP6963RequestProviderEvent** ‚Äî an event class that's being fired to request the wallet providers;

**EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent** ‚Äî an interface that represents the response from the wallet extension when the **'
eip6963:requestProvider'** event is fired;

**EIP6963ProviderDetail** is the main object we're interested in here. It contains two important properties:

**EIP6963ProviderInfo** which exposes metadata about the wallet extension;

**EIP1193Provider** which is a provider interface from
the [EIP-1193 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193#appendix-i-consumer-facing-api-documentation). This
should be used in the same way as the window.ethereum provider.

---

Now that we've got all the pieces in place, let's kick off the construction of a
simple [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) communication setup:

**// üìÅ file:  [injected-wallet-provider.ts](src/injected-wallet-provider/injected-wallet-provider.ts)**

```typescript
export class InjectedWalletProvider extends EventEmitter {
    // This will hold the details of the providers received
    providerDetails: EIP6963ProviderDetail[];

...

    // This method processes the provider details announced and adds them to the providerDetails array
    private providerReceived(providerDetail: EIP6963ProviderDetail): void {
        this.providerDetails.push(providerDetail);
        this.emit('providerDetailsUpdated')
        this.log(`updated wallet provider details from '${providerDetail.info.name}' extension`);
    }

    // This method listens for the 'announceProvider' event and processes the provider details announced
    subscribe(): void {
        window.addEventListener("eip6963:announceProvider", (event: EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent) => {
                this.log(`received 'announceProvider' emitted by ${event.detail.info.name} / ${event.detail.info.rdns}`);
                this.providerReceived(event.detail);
            }
        );
    }

    // This method is used to request wallet providers by firing a 'EIP6963RequestProviderEvent'
    requestProviders(): void {
        this.log("emitting 'requestProvider' event");
        this.providerDetails = [];
        window.dispatchEvent(new EIP6963RequestProviderEvent());
    }
}
```

First we have to call `subscribe` that will set up an event listener for `eip6963:announceProvider` event.
Next step is calling `requestProviders` to emit our request event.

Finally, we can see our events in the console:

![001-events-in-console.png](docs/001-events-in-console.png)

Let's dive into the **detail** parameter of the **'EIP6963ProviderDetail'**. It has two parts: **info** and **provider
**.

### üìç EIP6963ProviderDetail.info

First up, **info**. This is where the extension shares all its metadata with the DApp. We've already defined its
interface as ‚Äî **EIP6963ProviderInfo**.

Let's break down the data points we received (find full descriptions
here: [EIP-6963 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963#specification)):

**uuid** ‚Äî a unique identifier for each wallet provider announcement, allowing different EIP-1193 provider sessions to
be distinguished

> ‚ùó Keep in mind that **uuid** changes with each announcement, so it's not a reliable way to consistently identify the
> wallet extension!

**name** ‚Äî a user-friendly name of the Wallet Provider that can be displayed to the user on the DApp

**icon** ‚Äî an encoded image that represents the wallet provider's logo

> ‚ùó For security reasons you should always wrap received **icon** into `<img>` tag

**rdns** ‚Äî a unique identifier provided by the wallet in the form of a reversed domain name (like
com.example.subdomain). It's expected to stay the same throughout the wallet's lifespan, providing a stable identifier
for DApps to rely on across sessions.

> ‚ùó **rdns** is a consistent parameter that helps us identify the wallet across different sessions. We'll use that later
> for persistency.

### üìç EIP6963ProviderDetail.provider

The second part of the **'EIP6963ProviderDetail'** is the **provider**. This is an interface, known as **EIP1193Provider
**, that acts like a gateway to the user's account. You can use it in the same way you'd use **window.ethereum**.

The **EIP1193Provider** interface is a standard way for Ethereum wallets to talk to DApps. It's main usage is
the `request` method, this method takes a request object as a parameter: object should have a `method` property (a
string that names the method to be called) and it can also have a `params` property (this can be an array or an object,
and it holds the parameters for the method call). The `request` method gives back a Promise that resolves to the result
of the method call. This lets DApps interact with the Ethereum blockchain in a way that doesn't block the user
interface.

Example calls you usually make:

```typescript
await provider.request({method: 'eth_accounts'})

await provider.request({
    method: 'personal_sign',
    params: ['some message to sign', '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000']
});
```

## üìñ Section 2: Connecting to Wallet Accounts

When you want to access Ethereum accounts, you can use either `eth_requestAccounts` or `eth_accounts`.

**The difference?** `eth_requestAccounts` prompts the user to connect their wallet via the extension interface,
while `eth_accounts` simply returns a list of accounts already connected and available to the DApp.

Once the DApp requests access to the accounts, they stay connected. This means you only need to request access once. The
wallet extension takes care of persisting these connections.

### üîê eth_requestAccounts

To establish a connection with the accounts in the wallet extension, we should simply call **'eth_requestAccounts'**:

**// üìÅ file:  [DemoView.vue](src/components/DemoView.vue)**

```typescript
async function connectWalletAccount(providerDetail: EIP6963ProviderDetail) {
    try {
        const accounts = await providerDetail.provider.request({method: 'eth_requestAccounts'})
        setCurrentWalletAccount(accounts[0])
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(`error getting account: ${e}`);
    }
}
```

This action will prompt the selected wallet extension provider to display a dialog box, asking for permission to connect
to the available account:

![002-request-accounts.png](docs/002-request-accounts.png)

You will see the following in the console:

`current account has been set to: 0x4adad79b327a627395a5ed54f051b64f42249d3d`

Which means our DApp successfully got the ethereum account from the extension

### üîì eth_accounts

To get accounts previously connected via `eth_requestAccounts`, we should use method **'eth_accounts'**:

**// üìÅ file:  [DemoView.vue](src/components/DemoView.vue)**

```typescript
async function getConnectedWalletAccount(providerDetail: EIP6963ProviderDetail) {
    const accounts = await providerDetail.provider.request({method: 'eth_accounts'})
    if (accounts) {
        setCurrentWalletAccount(accounts[0])
    }
}
```

## üìñ Section 3: Message Signing and Sending a Transaction

In this part of the guide, you'll learn how modern DApps can leverage connected wallet providers to sign transactions in
a secure manner.

Let's start with an example of signing a string with the selected wallet:

```typescript
// signs a message by requesting the 'personal_sign' method from the provider
async function signMessage(providerDetail: EIP6963ProviderDetail) {
    try {
        const msg = signatureInputText.value;
        const signature = await providerDetail.provider.request({
            method: 'personal_sign',
            params: [msg, currentAccountAddress.value]
        });
        const signatureLog = `signed '${signatureInputText.value}' with ${providerDetail.info.name}, signature: ${signature}`;
        console.log(signatureLog);
        signatures.value.push(signatureLog);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`error signing: ${error}`);
    }
}
```

Now we can utilize **'eth_sendTransaction'** to send a transaction into the network:

```typescript
// sends a transaction by requesting the 'eth_sendTransaction' method from the provider
async function sendTransaction(providerDetail: EIP6963ProviderDetail) {
    // this is a demo implementation to avoid excesive dependencies
    // for production-ready apps you should use ethers / web3.js or bn.js to properly work with BigNumbers
    const value = `0x${parseInt(txValue.value).toString(16)}`;
    try {
        const transactionParameters = {
            to: txToAddress.value,
            from: currentAccountAddress.value,
            value: value,
        };
        const txHash = await providerDetail.provider.request({
            method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
            params: [transactionParameters],
        });
        console.log(`transaction sent with hash: ${txHash}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`error sending transaction: ${error}`);
    }
}
```

## üìñ Section 4: üóÑÔ∏è Using localStorage for persistence

Thanks to [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963), it's now possible to use multiple wallet extensions at
the same time. This opens up a scenario where you might want to stick with the same wallet extension every time you use
this DApp. To make this happen, we can save your choice in localStorage using the RDNS value of the chosen extension.
Just a quick reminder, the RDNS parameter is a unique identifier that each wallet extension provides.

**// üìÅ file:  [injected-wallet-provider.ts](src/injected-wallet-provider/injected-wallet-provider.ts)**

```typescript
  // This function stores the default provider.info.rdns in the local storage
storeDefaultProviderRdns(providerRdns
:
string
)
{
    window.localStorage.setItem(defaultProviderLocalStorageName, providerRdns);
    this.log(`stored default provider rdns '${providerRdns}' in local storage.`);
}

// This function retrieves the default provider.info.rdns from the local storage
readDefaultProviderRdns()
:
string | null
{
    const providerRdns = window.localStorage.getItem(defaultProviderLocalStorageName);
    this.log(`read default provider rdns '${providerRdns}' from local storage.`);
    return providerRdns;
}

// This function removes the default provider.info.rdns from the local storage
removeDefaultProvider()
{
    window.localStorage.removeItem(defaultProviderLocalStorageName);
    this.log("removed default provider rdns from local storage");
}
```
